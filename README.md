 Stigma, as described by the Cambridge Dictionary, refers to a strong feeling of
 disapproval held by the majority of individuals in a society towards something,
 particularly when it seems unfair. Within the context of mental health, individuals
 frequently face the full weight of societal stigma, which worsens the difficulties they
 already confront. This research explores the complex geography of mental health
 stigma by analysing Twitter data. The study aims to uncover the frequency and
 geographic variation of stigma-related information in tweets by employing a
 semi-supervised learning approach and machine learning techniques. The study
 evaluates the performance of various machine learning techniques, such as Support
 Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, by
 manually labelling a subset of tweets and considering the metrics of accuracy,
 precision, recall, and F1 score. This evaluation is done with an understanding of
 stigma. The results indicate that Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibit higher
 accuracy compared to other algorithms. In addition, a dashboard is created to visually
 represent mental health stigma distribution. This includes a choropleth map that
 displays the stigma for each country, a bar chart that illustrates the count of stigmas by
 country, and word clouds that highlight prevalent themes in negative and positive
 sentiment tweets. The dashboard improves comprehension of patterns of mental
 health stigma and enables stakeholders in mental health advocacy and policy-making
 to make well-informed decisions


Below is the dashboard of Stigma Prediction based on the Tweet
